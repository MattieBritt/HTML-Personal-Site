            <th> </th>
          </tr>

        <tr> 
          <td> </td>
          <td> </td>

<h2> Changing the Background Color of your Website/Body </h2>
<pre> There are multiple ways to change the background color of your Website/Body element
      You can do this by going to your body element and typing "background-color : __"
      There are many colors to choose from, and you can either list a color by name, or specifically use a hex code
</pre>

<h2> Inline CSS </h2>
<pre> Inline CSS is what it sounds like--it's CSS (styling) written within the actual lines of code, not as a separate document, or even a separate space on the page</pre>
<br>

<h2> Internal CSS </h2>
<pre> Similar to Inline CSS--Internal CSS is CSS that's written on a dedicated space in your HTML document using classes or general selectors (it will most likely go within the "head" part of your doc </pre>
<br>

<h2> External CSS </h2>
<pre> External CSS, my personal favorite, is a separate .css file, specifically for the css styling across your ENTIRE website
      This is useful for separating CSS from HTML, along with having more style options available
</pre>
<br>

<h2> CSS Hierarchy </h2>
<pre> CSS, evidently, has a hierarchical system when determining what style elements to use first and last
      First, it will use any inline code present within your HTML file
      Next, it will use any internal CSS code present within your HTML file
      And, finally, it will resort to the actual external CSS file with your styling elements
      Keep this in mind when working with future CSS elements! 

      Important Note : It's best practice to keep your CSS selectors/lines in alphabetical order 
      The reason behind this is to make it easier to find a specific line of code when you might be looking for it later on
</pre>
<br>

<h2> CSS Classes </h2>
<pre> Classes are selectors that allow you to call specific elements in order to apply style to them
      For example, if you have multiple images on your website, and you don't want all of them to have a background of, purple, for examplewebsite
      Instead of dealing with it, you can apply classes specifically to the images that you don't want to have a background color of purple

      Imporant Note - Differences between ID's and Classes : In short, classes are used for multiple elements, while an ID can only be used for one element
      Additionally, you can only have one id per element, but you can have multiple classes per element
</pre>

<br>

<h2> Favicons </h2>
<pre> Favicons are small images that will appear as the icon of the windowed tab 
      These icons can be anything, custom, or not
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Divs </h2>
<pre> A "div" stands for a "Content Division Element", it allows you to divide/split up your content/elements into separate boxes 
      This is helpful for making things look nice with precision spacing, while also being able to effect each box separately 
</pre>
<br>

<h2> The Box Model </h2>
<pre> The Box Model in HTML/CSS is a model for manipulating Divs, along with other particular elements (namely : Padding, Margin, Border, Width, and Height
      Padding - Padding causes the text to be separated from the border by a specified amount (it effects the area between the border and the text)
      Margin - Margin causes the box/div to be pushed away from any other element by a set amount (it spaces div/boxes from each other)
      Border - Border effects the border (duh) in how it looks and operates, you can make the border thicker, thinner, and on any side 
      Width + Height - Self explanatory, it effects the width and height of the element
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Display in CSS and HTML </h2>
<pre> Display is an attribute applied to many elements within CSS, as it sounds, diplay, affects how elements are displayed
      Here are the several types of display :
      Block - An element takes up an enitre line--no other elements can be on the same line as it, however you can change the width of the element
      Inline - An element that only takes up as much space as it needs, and other elements can be on the same line as it, however, you CAN'T change the width of the element
      Block-Inline - An element which takes the best of both worlds (from inline and block), you can both have several elements on the same line, AND edit their width
      None - None removes an element entirely, like it doesn't exist lol "Gone, reduced to atoms--I used the stones to destroy the stones"
</pre>

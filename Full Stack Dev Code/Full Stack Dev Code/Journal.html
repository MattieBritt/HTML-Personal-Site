<h1> Section 4 : Intro to CSS </h1>
<h2> Changing the Background Color of your Website/Body </h2>
<pre> There are multiple ways to change the background color of your Website/Body element
      You can do this by going to your body element and typing "background-color : __"
      There are many colors to choose from, and you can either list a color by name, or specifically use a hex code
</pre>

<h2> Inline CSS </h2>
<pre> Inline CSS is what it sounds like--it's CSS (styling) written within the actual lines of code, not as a separate document, or even a separate space on the page</pre>
<br>

<h2> Internal CSS </h2>
<pre> Similar to Inline CSS--Internal CSS is CSS that's written on a dedicated space in your HTML document using classes or general selectors (it will most likely go within the "head" part of your doc </pre>
<br>

<h2> External CSS </h2>
<pre> External CSS, my personal favorite, is a separate .css file, specifically for the css styling across your ENTIRE website
      This is useful for separating CSS from HTML, along with having more style options available
</pre>
<br>

<h2> CSS Hierarchy </h2>
<pre> CSS, evidently, has a hierarchical system when determining what style elements to use first and last
      First, it will use any inline code present within your HTML file
      Next, it will use any internal CSS code present within your HTML file
      And, finally, it will resort to the actual external CSS file with your styling elements
      Keep this in mind when working with future CSS elements! 

      Important Note : It's best practice to keep your CSS selectors/lines in alphabetical order 
      The reason behind this is to make it easier to find a specific line of code when you might be looking for it later on
</pre>
<br>

<h2> CSS Classes </h2>
<pre> Classes are selectors that allow you to call specific elements in order to apply style to them
      For example, if you have multiple images on your website, and you don't want all of them to have a background of, purple, for examplewebsite
      Instead of dealing with it, you can apply classes specifically to the images that you don't want to have a background color of purple

      Imporant Note - Differences between ID's and Classes : In short, classes are used for multiple elements, while an ID can only be used for one element
      Additionally, you can only have one id per element, but you can have multiple classes per element
</pre>
<br>

<h1> Section 5 : Intermediate CSS </h1>
<h2> Favicons </h2>
<pre> Favicons are small images that will appear as the icon of the windowed tab 
      These icons can be anything, custom, or not
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Divs </h2>
<pre> A "div" stands for a "Content Division Element", it allows you to divide/split up your content/elements into separate boxes 
      This is helpful for making things look nice with precision spacing, while also being able to effect each box separately 
</pre>
<br>

<h2> The Box Model </h2>
<pre> The Box Model in HTML/CSS is a model for manipulating Divs, along with other particular elements (namely : Padding, Margin, Border, Width, and Height
      Padding - Padding causes the text to be separated from the border by a specified amount (it effects the area between the border and the text)
      Margin - Margin causes the box/div to be pushed away from any other element by a set amount (it spaces div/boxes from each other)
      Border - Border effects the border (duh) in how it looks and operates, you can make the border thicker, thinner, and on any side 
      Width + Height - Self explanatory, it effects the width and height of the element
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Display in CSS and HTML </h2>
<pre> Display is an attribute applied to many elements within CSS, as it sounds, diplay, affects how elements are displayed
      Here are the several types of display :
      Block - An element takes up an enitre line--no other elements can be on the same line as it, however you can change the width of the element
      Inline - An element that only takes up as much space as it needs, and other elements can be on the same line as it, however, you CAN'T change the width of the element
      Block-Inline - An element which takes the best of both worlds (from inline and block), you can both have several elements on the same line, AND edit their width
      None - None removes an element entirely, like it doesn't exist lol "Gone, reduced to atoms--I used the stones to destroy the stones"
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Positioning </h2>
<pre> There are several types of positioning in CSS, including :
      Static - The default value, does nothing essentially 
      Relative - The element will move away (in other words, add a margin) towards the top, bottom, left, or right, in relativity to where the element should have been.
      (This is useful if you want to keep the flow of your document the same, as it doesn't move other elements around. However, keep in mind, you are moving it in the opposite direction of what you specify)
      Absolute - The element will move <strong> from </strong> the top, bottom, left, or right, in relativity to the parent document (In essence, you're moving it in the direction of where you're specifying)
      Fixed - The element will follow the user and stay fixed in its position across the website (very good for nav-bars or side-bars that you want to be seen at all times)

      Important Note, Natural Stacking Order - The natural stacking order in CSS dictates that whichever element comes first will be the furthest back (on the z plane)
      Additionally, "children sit on their parents", which can also be interpreted as nesting (elements within elements, divs within divs), dictates that the child element of a parent element will be on top 
    </pre>
<br> 

<h2> Tips Moving Forward </h2>

<ul>

  <li> Using the "width" feature instead of using margins to corral elements on the page </li>
  <li> When you use the width feature and it messes up the centering of elements, instead of using padding, use "margin : auto" </li>
  <li> Use the "float" propxerty to wrap text around an image (to the left or right of it) </li>
  <li> A border will not display unless you specify a border type </li>
  <li> Padding spaces out an element within its div, while a margin spaces out elements outside of the div </li>
  <li> "Block-Inline" is good for having multiple elements (or divs) on the same line, with the ability to still edit their width </li>

</ul>
<br>

<h1> Section 6 : Intro To Bootstrap 4 (Currently 5) </h1>
<pre> Bootstrap is a library focused on ease of access and convenience for CSS (in essence it allows making things look pretty, to be easy)
      The best way to intialize bootstrap and utilize it in a project/website is to use the direct link href from "https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/"
      It has all sorts of bits and bops so I'm looking forward to seeing what all I can do with it!
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Bootstrap - Grid Layout </h2>
<pre> Bootstrap has a ton of cool functions within its library, one of them being the grid layout
      This allows you to add columns and rows to your website, which are modular, depending on your screen size
      To do this, you start out with a div with the class of "row", and then include a div within it with the class of "col"
      Afterwards, it gets a bit more complicated, as you can define how many columns you want for a certain screen size
      To summarize, imagine across an entire screen you have 12 boxes, and you can specify how many boxes you want across the screen at any given time (within a certain screen size)
      For example : On desktops and laptops, I want there to be 6 boxes, on ipads, I want there to be 4 boxes, and on mobile, I want the column to take up the entire screen
      Look at the code for an example of how it would look :

      <!-- 

 <div class = "row">
    
    <div class = "col-lg-2 col-md-3 col-sm-1" style = "background-color : purple; border : 1px solid;"> 
    col-lg-6 col-md-4 col-sm-1
      </div>
    <div class = "col-lg-2 col-md-3 col-sm-1" style = "background-color : purple; border : 1px solid;"> 
    col-lg-6 col-md-4 col-sm-1
      </div>
    <div class = "col-lg-2 col-md-3 col-sm-1" style = "background-color : purple; border : 1px solid;"> 
    col-lg-6 col-md-4 col-sm-1
      </div>
    <div class = "col-lg-2 col-md-3 col-sm-1" style = "background-color : purple; border : 1px solid;"> 
    col-lg-6 col-md-4 col-sm-1
      </div>
    <div class = "col-lg-2 col-md-3 col-sm-1" style = "background-color : purple; border : 1px solid;"> 
    col-lg-6 col-md-4 col-sm-1
      </div>
    <div class = "col-lg-2 col-md-3 col-sm-1" style = "background-color : purple; border : 1px solid;"> 
    col-lg-6 col-md-4 col-sm-1
      </div>
    
</div>

      -->
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Bootstrap - Containers </h2>
<pre> Containers in bootstrap are essentially divs, except they have an inate modular style to them (tl;dr - they adjust to the screen size accordingly)
      "container" - can be jarring (arguably worse in most situations) will adjust to the screen size by jumping between the different pixel (screen) sizes 
      "container-fluid" - will always take up 100% of the screen size and smoothly transition accordingly as the screen size changes
</pre>
<br> 

<h2> Tips Moving Forward, Pt.2 </h2>

<ul>

  <li> Instead of targeting individual lines or elements, target ids and classes more broadly </li>
  <li> To re-iterate in a way that's easier to understand : padding pushes things away inside of an element, margin pushed things away outside of an element </li>
  <li> Transform exists, and can be helpful </li>
  <li> To include multiple classes within a row div, type the class before the bootstrap modifiers </li>
  <li> ".icon" works the same as "i" </li>

</ul>
<br>

<h1> Section 7 : Intermediate Bootstrap </h1>
<br>

<h2> The Carousel </h2>
<pre> A carousel in Bootstrap allows you to cycle through images and/or text that you can display within the carousel
      There are various properties such as how fast you want the carousel to cycle through ("data-bs-interval"), if you want it to be automatic ("data-bs-ride = "carousel"")
      If you want the carousel to pause while your cursor is hovering over it ("data-bs-pause : "hover""), etc
      You need to have an "active" tag on one of your carousel items to be displayed by default when your website launches
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Cards </h2>
<pre> Cards in bootstrap have a variety of uses, but in this context I'll be talking about them as a visual pricing scale 
      Cards are exactly as they sound like, they're a grid, that resembles a card, which is used to display information
      You can add a heading, a footer, a title they're pretty customizable and are also compatible with everything else within Bootstrap
      Here is some example code from my Tinder clone that demonstrates cards : 

      As you can see, it's held within a grid and includes a list, along with a button 
      Make sure that when creating cards, you make separate divs for the column class and the card class itself

      <!-- <div class="row">

        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3 class="card-header"> Chihuahua </h3>
              <h5 class="card-title"> Free </h5>
                <p class="list-group-item"> 5 Matches Per Day </p>
                <p class="list-group-item"> 10 Messages Per Day </p> 
                <p class="list-group-item"> Unlimited App Usage </p>
                <div class = "d-grid gap-2">
                <button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-light btn-outline-dark" id = "reg"> Sign Up for Free </button>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
  
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3 class="card-header"> Labrador </h3>
              <h5 class="card-title"> $49 / mo </h5>
              <p class="list-group-item"> Unlimited Per Day </p>
              <p class="list-group-item"> Unlimited Messages Per Day </p> 
              <p class="list-group-item"> Unlimited App Usage </p>
              <div class = "d-grid gap-2"> 
              <button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-dark" id = "reg"> Sign Up </button>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
  
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12">
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <h3 class="card-header"> Mastiff </h3>
              <h5 class="card-title"> $99 / mo </h5>
              <p class="list-group-item"> Priority Listing </p>
              <p class="list-group-item"> Unlimited Per Day </p>
              <p class="list-group-item"> Unlimited Messages Per Day </p> 
              <p class="list-group-item"> Unlimited App Usage </p>
              <div class = "d-grid gap-2"> 
              <button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-dark mastiff" id = "mastiff" > Sign Up </button>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
  
      </div>  -->
</pre>
<br> 

<h2> Z-Index and Stacking Order </h2>
<pre> The Z-Index is the value that each element has which determines where they sit on the visual heirarchy, for example, all elements have a Z-Index of 0 as a base 
      If I changed a particular element to have a Z-Index of -1, it would then go behind all of the elements that had a higher Z-Index
      In lamens terms, the Z-Index value determines whether or not an element will be on top of, or behind, another element (in order)

      Important Note : Using the Z-Index can be complicated because the CSS stacking order plays a role as well, however, if you want to use the Z-Index on an element, it HAS to have a "position : " to work
      In my short amount of experience using it, I've found that the relative position is generally the best to use, but it depends on the circumstances of what you're trying to accomplish
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Media Query Breakpoints </h2>
<pre> A media query breakpoint is a native CSS feature that allows you to make changes when certain parameters are met
      For example (and most likely a realistic one), I want to make my text larger when the screen size (resolution) is detected going from a laptop resolution, to a tablet/phone resolution
      It's essentially a boolean and an if/else statement combined

      Example : &lt; @media (max-width : 900px) &gt;

      You can also combined multiple media queries with "and" between queries 
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Code Refactoring </h2>
<pre> Within coding, as a basic foundational rule, it's important to keep your code as neat (readable) as possible
      To help with this, you want to keep your code "DRY" (DRY : "Don't Repeat Yourself")
      This would fall into the category of keeping the broader additions to your code for the classes and the sections, while keeping the specific additions to individual elements

      A few ways to improve your code through refactoring goes as follows : 
      1. Readability - If an axe murderer was reading your code, how much would they want to murder you after they were finished? (Keep code clean to avoid axe murderers, and angry co-workers)
      2. Modularity - How modular is your code? (How easy is it for you to locate sections, classes, ids, and elements within your website? How easily can you edit your code without effecting the rest of the website?)
      3. Efficiency - How efficient is your code? How fast does your code execute and process?
      4. Length - How long is your code? Self explanatory, doesn't really matter for anything except code golf ;p

      You can also use combined selectors with sections to easily refactor your code over a broad scale, increasing both readabiliy and modularity
</pre>
<br>

<h2> Combining Selectors </h2>
<pre> Combining CSS selectors allows you to get more specific within your code, here are some ways you can combine CSS selectors :
      Multiple Selectors - A good example of this is in the Tindog project (Tinder Clone)--located within the stylesheet there is a selector targeting h1 through h6, using commas
      Ex : selector1, selector2 {}

      Hierarchical Selectors (Read right to left, child --> parent) - The first selector is from the parent element and the second selector is from the child element, this type of selection allows you to get very specific with your code
      Ex : selector1 selector2 {}

      Combined Selectors (Read left to right, occurs within the same element) - An id or class being combined with an html element, for example
      Ex : h1#title {color : red;}

</pre>
<br>

<h2> Selector Priority </h2>
<pre> Here is the order of CSS selector priority (in other words, which addition to your code will actually visibly apply)
      HTML Selector --> CSS Class --> CSS ID --> Inline CSS 
    
      Some tips to avoid running into priority errors are :
      1. Avoid using ID's over classes (use ID's sparingly)--just because there's only one of something doesn't mean it should get an ID (sections are good for ID's)
      2. Only use one class when applying classes to your elements (when using multiple classes on the same element (that all contribute something different to the element), it can easily result in errors)
      3. Avoid Inline Styles AT ALL COSTS! (I don't like using them anyways haha)
</pre>


<h2> Tips Moving Forward, P.3</h2>

<ul> 
  <li> To clarify, and re-iterate, don't target specific ids, classes, or elements, unnecessarily--instead, target the highest parent div/element you can</li>
  <li> When using a link with an included href, you can use ids of specific sections within the page that will bring them to that part of the page</li>
  <li> Instead of using width in place of padding, just use padding instead, only use width for its intended purpose (to limit the width of an element) (seems like common sense, but, live and learn lol)</li>
</ul>
